<h1> </h1><p id="question-header"> Question 1 of 8 </p><div id="rcorners-question"> <pre>The sky is</pre> </div>
<div id="rcorners-text"> <p>The sky in Portugal is currently blue. It is 12:44 PM in Portugal, so the sun is high in the sky and the light is scattered evenly in all directions. This causes the sky to appear blue.</p>
<p>However, the sky can also appear other colors, depending on the time of day, the weather conditions, and the location. For example, at sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes. And if there are clouds in the sky, they can reflect different colors of light, causing the sky to appear different colors as well.</p>
<p>So, the next time you look up at the sky, remember that it is not always blue!</p>
 </div><p id="question-header"> Question 2 of 8 </p><div id="rcorners-question"> <pre>Complete the sentence:
The sky is
</pre> </div>
<div id="rcorners-text"> <p>The sky is vast and ever-changing. It can be blue, green, yellow, red, orange, or even purple. It can be clear, cloudy, or stormy. It can be full of stars or empty.</p>
<p>The sky is a place of wonder and mystery. It is a place where anything is possible. It is a place where dreams can come true.</p>
<p>So, the sky is…</p>
<ul>
<li>A vast ocean of air that surrounds the Earth.</li>
<li>A home to clouds, birds, and airplanes.</li>
<li>A place where the sun, moon, and stars shine.</li>
<li>A source of beauty and inspiration.</li>
<li>A reminder of our connection to the universe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sky is… what you make it. It is a blank canvas that you can fill with your own imagination. It is a place where you can dream big and reach for the stars.</p>
<p>So, go out and explore the sky! See what you can find.</p>

</pre> </div>
<div id="rcorners-text"> <p>The current president of Portugal is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. He was elected in 2016 and re-elected in 2021. He is a member of the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The current king of Spain is Felipe VI. He ascended to the throne in 2014 after the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos I. Felipe VI is a constitutional monarch and has limited powers.</p>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
 </div><p id="question-header"> Question 4 of 8 </p><div id="rcorners-question"> <pre>This is awesome! // Positive
This is bad! // Negative
Wow that movie was rad! // Positive
What a horrible show! //
</pre> </div>
<div id="rcorners-text"> <p>Here are some other negative words that you can use to replace “horrible”:</p>
<ul>
<li>awful</li>
<li>dreadful</li>
<li>terrible</li>
<li>disgusting</li>
<li>sickening</li>
<li>appalling</li>
<li>nauseating</li>
<li>repulsive</li>
<li>loathsome</li>
<li>abhorrent</li>
<li>odious</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use negative phrases, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a complete disaster.</li>
<li>I couldn’t believe how bad it was.</li>
<li>I’m never watching that again.</li>
<li>I’m so glad it’s over.</li>
<li>I’m going to go wash my eyes out now.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to be aware of the power of language. The words we use can have a big impact on our mood and the way we perceive the world around us. Using negative language can make us feel down and pessimistic. So, it’s a good idea to try to use positive language whenever possible.</p>
<p>However, there are also times when it’s appropriate to use negative language. For example, if you’re trying to warn someone about something dangerous or harmful, it’s important to be clear and direct. In these cases, negative language can be a valuable tool for communication.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best way to use language is to be mindful of the impact it has on others. When you’re speaking or writing, think about how your words will make the person on the receiving end feel. If you want to create a positive and uplifting experience, use positive language. If you want to be clear and direct, use negative language when necessary. But always be respectful and considerate of the other person.</p>

# Imprecise
Keep the explanation short, only a few sentences, and don't be too descriptive.

 </div><p id="question-header"> Question 6 of 8 </p><div id="rcorners-question"> <pre># Avoid Impreciseness
Use 2-3 sentences to explain the concept of prompt engineering to a high
school student.
</pre> </div>
<div id="rcorners-text"> <p>Sure, here is a 2-3 sentence explanation of prompt engineering for a high school student:</p>
<p>Prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions to a large language model (LLM) to get it to generate the desired output. The instructions are written in natural language and can be used to control the style, content, and format of the output.</p>
<p>For example, a prompt engineer might want to generate a poem about love. They could write an instruction like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a poem about love that is both beautiful and heartbreaking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This instruction would give the LLM the general idea of what the poem should be about, but it would also allow the LLM to be creative and come up with its own unique interpretation.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but I need more information on what kind of movies you like in order to give you a good recommendation. Here are some questions that might help me:</p>

<p>Here are some other questions that the agent could ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your favorite movies?</li>
<li>What movies have you seen recently?</li>
<li>What movies are you planning to watch?</li>
